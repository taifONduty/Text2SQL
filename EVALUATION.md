## 3. Failed Queries Analysis

### 3.1 Failed Query Examples

[To be filled with actual failures]

**Example 1:**
- **Question**: [Question text]
- **Generated SQL**: [SQL query]
- **Error**: [Error message]
- **Root Cause**: [Analysis]
- **Potential Fix**: [Suggested improvement]

### 3.2 Common Failure Patterns

1. **Schema Misunderstanding**: [X] failures
   - LLM misinterprets table relationships
   - Uses non-existent column names
   
2. **Complex Logic**: [X] failures
   - Difficulty with multi-step reasoning
   - Subquery nesting issues
   
3. **Date Handling**: [X] failures
   - Date format inconsistencies
   - Timezone issues

---

## 4. Database Optimization Opportunities

### 4.1 Current Indexes

The schema includes the following indexes:
- Single-column indexes on foreign keys
- Composite indexes on frequently joined columns
- Date indexes for temporal queries

### 4.2 Suggested Improvements

1. **Add covering indexes** for common query patterns:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date_amount 
   ON orders(customer_id, order_date, freight);
   ```

2. **Partial indexes** for frequently filtered data:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_products_active 
   ON products(category_id) 
   WHERE discontinued = false;
   ```

3. **Materialized views** for expensive aggregations:
   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
   SELECT ...
   ```
